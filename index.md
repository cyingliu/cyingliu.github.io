I am a 2nd year master student at Stanford University, electrical engineering.  I completed my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University.  Previously, I worked as a deep learning intern at VIA Technologies Inc., developing bird-eye view perception systems. I am interested in machine learning and NLP.

## Project

### [Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning for Multi-task Learning](https://github.com/cyingliu/CS224n-Efficient-MT-BERT)
Designed a BERT multi-task classifier that could build robust embeddings and performed well across sentiment, paraphrase, and similarity tasks, while being parameter efficient. 

###  Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Semantic Guidance
Designed a framework that performed self-supervised monocular depth estimation and fused semantic information to enhance depth prediction. 

### Efficient-tuning Methods in Self-supervised Speech Models
Analyzed six different efficient tuning methods, including prefix tuning, weighted sum and adapters, on speech self-supervised learning models, and showed that these methods can achieve comparable performance to finetuning with less than 1% trainable parameters of finetuning. 

### Guiding Chatbot
Developed a Chinese chatbot that can induce its interlocutor to response with specific sentiment.

### Fine-grained Long-tailed Food Classification
Developed a model that can perform food classification over a large-scale dataset that has more than 200 different categories and imbalanced data distribution and achieved 85% accuracy over all data and 61% accuracy over rare data. 

### HierarchiOrg Website 
Developed a website that provided efficient functions for hierarchical organizations to manage tasks.

### Video Chat Program with Self-Implemented RTP Protocol 
Devise a video chat program that can transmit video, audio, and transcripts between multiple users. 

### Code Generation with Multi-task Learning

### Game Theory in Lane Changing
